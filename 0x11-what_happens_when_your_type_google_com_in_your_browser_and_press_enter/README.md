Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type “https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter? In this blog post, I will take you on a journey through the various stages of a web request, unraveling the intricate processes involved in delivering the Google search page to your screen. From the initial DNS request to the final database retrieval, let’s dive in and explore the fascinating world of web technology.

    <li>
    DNS Request: When you press Enter after typing “https://www.google.com," the first step is a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with the domain name “www.google.com." The DNS server responds with the IP address, allowing your browser to establish a connection.
    </li>
    <li>
    TCP/IP: With the IP address in hand, your browser initiates a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection. TCP breaks down data into packets and ensures reliable de livery by establishing a connection between your browser and the server hosting Google. IP, on the other hand, takes care of routing the packets across the internet.
    </li>
    <li>
    Firewall: Once the TCP/IP connection is established, the request passes through a firewall. The firewall acts as a security barrier, monitoring and filtering incoming traffic. It checks if the request is legitimate and allows it to proceed if no suspicious activity is detected.
    </li>
    <li>
    HTTPS/SSL: As the request progresses, it encounters the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol, which ensures secure communication between your browser and the server. The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), encrypts the data exchanged, safeguarding it from potential eavesdropping or tampering.
    </li>
    <li>
    Load-Balancer: To handle the immense traffic Google receives, load-balancers come into play. A load-balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring efficient resource utilization and high availability. It helps Google respond to millions of requests simultaneously and maintain a smooth user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
    Web Server: At this stage, the request reaches the web server, which hosts the Google search page. The web server processes the request and retrieves the necessary files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to construct the webpage you see on your screen. It may also interact with other servers, such as application servers or databases, to gather the required information.
    </li>
    <li>
    Application Server: Complex web applications, like Google Search, often rely on application servers to handle dynamic content generation. These servers execute code, interact with databases, and perform various computations to provide personalized search results and other advanced functionalities.
    </li>
    <li>
    Database: Behind the scenes, Google’s vast database infrastructure comes into play. The application server queries the databases to fetch relevant search results, user preferences, and other data necessary to construct the search page. This process involves complex algorithms and massive data processing capabilities to ensure speedy and accurate results.
