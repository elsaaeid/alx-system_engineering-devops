# Command Line For The Win
<br />
<hr />
These are screenshots from my progress in the <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/">COMMAND LINE CHALLENGE.</a>
<br />

<p>CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!</p>
<br />
<h3>This repository contains projects from all three categories of the command-line challenge:</h3>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/">CMDChallenge with 42 tasks</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://oops.cmdchallenge.com/">oops.CMDChallenge with 5 tasks</a></li>
    <li>and The <a href="https://12days.cmdchallenge.com/">12days.CMDChallenge with 12 tasks</a></li>
</ul>
